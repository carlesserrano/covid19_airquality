### Hi guys!

This repository is meant to share the project I've started within Coursera course "Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python". This course, together with a series of 5 additional courses, belongs to the ["Python for Everybody (PY4E)"](https://www.py4e.com/) specialization.

I would like to thank the instructor or these courses, Charles R. Severance (AKA [Dr. Chuck](http://www.dr-chuck.com/)), and obviously all the teaching staff of PY4E for the great work that they have done designing these courses as well as with sharing all this knowledge with the community.

The purpose of the project is to retrieve air quality data from public and open data sources, for those locations that have been locked out with their population confined at home as a contention measure for COVID-19 outbreak, trying to depict the positive effect of the populationâ€™s confinement over the environmental conditions of the most crowded cities on the world.

Please feel free to use this project if their content is useful for you! Comments and contributions will be welcome! :smile:

Thanks!
